Lebron picks Alex Caruso, the living legend. The game starts and Lebron immediately passes to Alex, letting him take the ball up the floor. He knows he can get open, but also knows Caruso is automatic from everywhere on the court:

# callforball
Lebron calls for the ball and Caruso passes it. He shoots from the corner and airballs.
